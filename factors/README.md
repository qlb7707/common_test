##A test for method to get the number of factors of a given digit

###main idea

if there is a digit1 in the range of (2,sqrt(digit)) which is a factor,

then there must be a correspond factor digit2 in the range of (sqrt(digit),digit - 1) 

wrt. $digit1 \times digit2 = digit$ 

if digit is a squre number then there must be a pair of (digit1,digit2) wrt $digit1 =  digit2$
